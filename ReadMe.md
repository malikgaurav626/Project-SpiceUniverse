# Project-SpiceUniverse

## My First Sem project:

Spice Universe is a text based Action-Adventure game.
Enter in the Spice Universe and enjoy a small dose of reality escape from the day-to-day life.
It's got about 15-30 minutes of gameplay with immersive stories and 4 different classes to choose from.\
There are 4 diffrent stats of enemies.

## Controls

### Combat Controls:
1 for hit\
2 for block (get 2 DMG)\
3 for dodge (No DMG Taken)\
4 for heal (+40 HP)\
5 for special ability\
(Special Move can’t be dodge or blocked)\
(it’s hidden in the player move menu but it is a viable option)\
(Right now special ability of all classes are just damaging entities and has no other meaning to them)\
NOTE: resting restores your max HP

## Classes:
In SpiceUniverse you can choose different classes which have their own benifits

#### 1. [Warrior]:

Warrior class will provide your character to have some previous experience in combat and elevated defensive abilities. The Warrior class provides these different equipment upon choosing:\
• Primary Weapon: FireSword (5 DMG)\
• Heals: 1 (+40 HP) (if you use heal before your health drops below max HP then health restores to max HP and DP converts to 0)\
• Health: 120 HP\
• Defence: 17 DP (DP is just elevated HP, so total health=HP+DP)\
